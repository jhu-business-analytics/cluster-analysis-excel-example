# Using Cluster Analysis to Create Better Programming and Resources for Johns Hopkins Life Science PhD Students

## Background

In our previous types of analysis, we’ve focused on how to draw insights from trends across time, geographic regions, or sub-groupings of data and from regression and correlation analyses where we could see how different input variables might affect or predict some desired output. What these types of analyses don’t tell us is how the data might be naturally grouped based on specified variables and if there more explanatory trends within these groups compared to the entire dataset. We can use __cluster analysis__ to mathematically determine how data points are mathematically related to each other based on how close they are to a center *node* in each data group. 

In this example, we’ll work with data from the [Next Generation Life Science](http://nglscoalition.org/coalition-data/#close) Coalition, which is a growing group of academic institutions that provide open data about life science PhD and postdoctoral programs including admission and matriculation rates, program completion length, and job sector and job type post-graduation. Recently, the [Johns Hopkins Life Design Lab](https://studentaffairs.jhu.edu/life-design/) started the [Phutures](https://hub.jhu.edu/2020/02/25/hopkins-launches-phutures-999-em0-art1-dtd-news/) program which aims to “serve as the hub for PhD and postdoc professional development and life design, a philosophy of career development that takes a holistic view of students' curiosity and empowers them to experiment, prototype, and connect.” While qualitative and individual-level efforts are necessary for this program’s success, we can also use data at a higher level to gain insights about what types of careers PhD students typically go into and how these job sectors and types change throughout one’s career trajectory. 

With this data (at least from the life science departments), we can group seemingly similar departments into different clusters or groups based on where students end up immediately, 5 years, and 10 years post-graduation, so the Life Design Lab can better identify programs, information sessions, and program-specific announcements for the different departments on campus. These clusters can give us insight into what fields and job types that students in departments are typically drawn to (so we can focus on those programs for those jobs), or so we can focus on programming in the departments that typically don’t venture into specific job types or sectors to help them understand different career options that they might not have realized are viable career options. The Life Design Lab can also use this data to better inform company recruiters on the types of jobs that PhD and post-doc students are typically drawn to, so that they can better focus their recruiting strategy at JHU.

### __*How can the JHU Life Design Lab design and provide better services for PhD and Post-Doc students for careers outside of academia and connect with more employers who would benefit from PhD-level job candidates, but might not recruit these types of students?*__
